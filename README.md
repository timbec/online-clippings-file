## About Lnkr (the name is a joke)

The problem:

- I end up with dozens, hundreds even, of urls of links I want to read later, links I need for work, links I'd like to have long-term access. Bookmarks get cluttered very quickly and I don't use them anymore.

I have tried other options, like Evernote, but something about the interface and way of collecting links didn't work for me - so I decided to try building my own.

For my own use: a way to save links for whatever reason. Keep recipes I want to find again, tutorials, links I return to often, feeds, etc. Whatever I have to keep on file.

At the moment, I keep dozens (or more) of text files in various dropbox folders. This is confusing and makes finding the links again difficult.

Various topics:

## General Interest:

- News

- things like recipes I want on file and want to be able to categorize and find easily, by category, sub-categories, or tags.
- I would like to be able to create this as an API, to be access on different sites.

- I would also like to be able to prioritize links so that they are the first thing I see when I open an app.

- I would like to be able to preview the app (or just have the link appear with the preview by default)

## Work

- I would like to replicate the current system I have with different notepads, with links grouped either by each project, or sub-groups of a particular project. However, unlike the current system of notepads within a directory, these groups of links would be:

1. searchable
2. categorized and tagged.

- they can be categorized and tagged to be available in each project, within the entire work space, or the entire site.

- Different categories and even tags can be made available as an API. For examples, recipes, queryable by an API, for easy search.

## Phase II: Dev ToolBox

- This might eventually be a separate app but since, for the time being this is for personal use.

- A second component is an explicit dev toolbox, with notes, and a coding repository. Like the links, the code repository is 1) searchable, categorized (presumably by language), and tags.
- The code would also include notes, in a setup similar to Jupyter Notebooks, downloadable as a file, but also stored in a database, and convertable as an API.

## Phase III

- my wife is a librarian, and she told me she and her colleagues need a system at work to share links, sometimes person to person, sometimes as a common pool. Evernote has the ability to share notes, so I asked her to try Evernote first then tell me what it doesn't do that could be added to a custom app.
